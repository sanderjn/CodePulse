# CodePulse Website

Thanks for checking out the source code. Since I'm using TailwindCSS and AlpineJS, most of the magic happens in the good ol' [index.html](index.html). Go check it out!

## Libraries/Frameworks Used

-   TailwindCSS
-   AlpineJS
-   Vite

### TailwindCSS

A utility-first CSS framework that greatly speeds up my development work. TailwindCSS is highly customizable and helps reduce CSS file size by automatically removing unused styles.

### AlpineJS

AlpineJS is a lightweight JavaScript framework, ideal for adding dynamic behavior to your website. Its main feature is the ability to directly integrate interactive elements into HTML, making it a convenient choice for smaller projects or enhancing specific parts of a web page.

### Vite

Vite is a front-end development tool that enables quick deployment through Netlify. It's known for its fast performance, especially when it comes to refreshing pages as you code (hot module replacement). Vite also makes the final build of a webpage more efficient, which is beneficial for faster loading times and better performance.
